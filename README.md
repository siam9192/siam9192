<h2>Hi 👋, I'm Arafat</h2>

A passionate Full Stack Web Developer on a mission to craft seamless, intuitive, and impactful digital experiences.
With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I enjoy building everything from responsive web interfaces to robust server-side applications. I thrive on turning ideas into real-world products using modern frameworks and clean, maintainable code.

💻 On the frontend, I specialize in technologies like React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI, focusing on building fast, accessible, and responsive user interfaces.

🛠️ On the backend, I work with tools such as Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, and I’m continuously exploring technologies like GraphQL, Prisma, and Docker to expand my capabilities.

🎯 I’m driven by curiosity and a problem-solving mindset, always aiming to improve performance, enhance user experience, and follow best development practices.

### 3.MPI Library (employee-management)
  <a href = 'https://github.com/siam9192/MPI-library-manaagement-system-backend'>MPI Library Code Link</a>

### 🚀 Features

- The system defines four distinct user roles: **Student**, **Librarian**, **Admin**, and **SuperAdmin** — each with different levels of access and responsibilities within the library system.
- The system uses fully custom authentication implemented with **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** to securely manage user sessions and protect routes based on roles.
- Handle student registration requests and manage library memberships for students and staff. Keep track of members' borrowing activities efficiently.
- Add, update, and delete book records with complete details including title, author, category, and available copies.
- Students can follow/unfollow authors. They'll receive notifications when a new book from their followed author arrives in the library.
- Sudents can request to borrow books or reserve them until an expiration date if currently unavailable.
- Upon successful reservation, students receive a unique ticket to verify their identity when collecting the book.
- Monitor book lending activities — who borrowed what, due dates, return status, and check if borrowing limits are met.
- Automatically calculate fines for overdue, lost, or damaged books. Librarians or admins have the ability to waive fines when necessary.
- Students can view their complete borrowing history, including past borrowed books, return dates, and penalties (if any).
- Penalties are issued for improper behavior such as canceling reservations frequently, failing to pick up reserved books, late returns, damaging or losing books, or not paying fines. These penalties may affect borrowing privileges.
- Notify students about due dates, reservations, fines, and other events via logs, UI messages, or email (based on the system’s integration).
- Students can reach out for help or raise queries via the support system.
- System behavior can be customized, including settings such as application name, system open/close status, expiration dates, and other configurable options.
- Includes email verification via OTP, password reset using an email link, change password functionality, and user profile updates.
- Generate insightful reports on monthly library usage, fine collections, and book inventory status.
